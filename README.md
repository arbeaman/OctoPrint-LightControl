=======
# OctoPrint Light Control
This OctoPrint plugin controls printer lights to reduce power use when the printer is not in use.

It adds a lightbulb icon at the top of the octoprint screen, on the navbar, that can be clicked to turn on and off the controlled lights.  This is only fully fucntional when the TPLink subplugin is used.

Lights can be automatically switched on when user specified commands are sent to the printer and/or switched off when idle. (work in progress)

Supports Commands (G-Code or System) or GPIO to switch power supply on/off. (work in progress)
